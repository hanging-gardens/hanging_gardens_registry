, "description"   : "Modernizr is a script that detects native CSS3 and HTML5 features available in the current UA and provides an object containing all features with a true/false value, depending on whether the UA has native support for it or not. Modernizr will also add classes to the <html> element of the page, one for each feature it detects. If the UA supports it, a class like \"cssgradients\" will be added. If not, the class name will be \"no-cssgradients\". This allows for simple if-conditionals in your CSS, giving you fine control over the look & feel of your website."
